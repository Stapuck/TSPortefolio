Balancing these two projects has not always been easy: compromises had to be made and sacrifices accepted, but always with the goal of getting closer to my final objective. This has led me to optimize my time as much as possible.",

Although I practice primarily for pleasure, I believe that the variety of sports I engage in daily helps me avoid excessive pressure. Just as a balance between professional and personal life is necessary, I make sure to clearly separate my sports practice from other aspects of my life. I have noticed that when my daily life is well-balanced and my different areas of life are stable, my sports performance naturally follows. Finally, I place great importance on avoiding comparisons with other athletes, since my situation is uncommon and involves different routines and opportunities.",
